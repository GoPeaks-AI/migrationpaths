# migrationpaths

Author: Victor Zitian Chen (UNC Charlotte; GoPeaks)

This repo shows Plotly coding for an interactive map showing migration pathsã€‚

To run this migration path, users need:
1. the world cities table with location names (e.g., cities, states, countries, etc.) and their longitudes and latidudes.
2. the bivariate paths and intensity (e.g., counts of people and businesses) between the starting and ending locations.
3. Python Plotly and Pandas packages.
