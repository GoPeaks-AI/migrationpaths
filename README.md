# migrationpaths

This repo shows Plotly coding for an interactive map showing migration paths.

To run this migration path, users need to:
1. select a subset from the world cities table with location names (e.g., cities, states, countries, etc.) and their longitudes and latidudes.
2. create  bivariate paths and intensity (e.g., counts of people and businesses) between the starting and ending locations.
3. install Python Plotly and Pandas packages, and run the Jupyter notebook. Remember to change the drive path to your local drive.
